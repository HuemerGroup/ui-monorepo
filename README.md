Template for a "React with TypeScript and Storybook" monorepo. If you want to build multiple React apps with one UI library, this template is worth taking a look.

## Prerequisites
We use yarn workspaces, so you will need `yarn`. The additional tooling needed will be set up by yarn.

## HowTo
First you should replace `my-org` with your organization/project/framework name in all files.
After that just run `yarn setup`.

Run `yarn start` to start the development environment.
